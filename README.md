# NeRF-view-synthesizer
Synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by representing those scenes as Neural Radiance Fields.

## Description:
Representing a scene using a *fully-connected deep neural network* and synthesize the novel views of complex scene by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views.
